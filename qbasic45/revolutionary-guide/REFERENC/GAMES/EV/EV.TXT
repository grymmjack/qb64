 I. About myself

        Hi, my name is Dave Cote, and I am the person who made Extreme
Velocity.  I am 16 years old and live in Saskatchewan, Canada.  I first
made the game for a programing course in school, and never expected it to
reach whoever is reading this.  I have programing in QBASIC and GWBASIC for
a couple years now and this is my best game so far.  I want to buy Visual
Basic but I need more cash, so donations are VERY welcome.  My address is at
the bottom of this text file.

 II. About Extreme Velocity

        Extreme Velocity was made in GWBASIC for a school project, and
I seem to have all or almost all of the bugs worked out.  It should work fine
on anything from a 286 to a Pentium 133 or better if you change the machine
speed setting at the beginning of the game.

 III. Secret Car ???

        There is a secret car in Extreme Velocity which can be goten by going
to the car selection screen and typeing SEEKRET.  You must not type anything
before it or it will not work.  If it dosen't work, push escape to return to
the main menu and then back the car selection screen to try again.  The stats
on it are 6 Accel., 4 Cornering, and 7 Top speed.

 IV. Extreme Velocity II

        After making Extreme Velocity, I found a lot of things that I could 
do to make it better.  I am Currently making Extreme Velocity II.  It will
still have the same basic concept but it will have:

                        - Oponent cars on the track
                        - Weapons, lasers, missels, BOOM!
                        - More cars, and more detail
                        - More tracks
                        
        It is being made in QBASIC and will not work in GWBASIC.  If you want
to buy a copy for five dollars in canadian funds, or send donations towards 
Visual Basic, to:

Thanks alot
