| = cursor

cursor rules:
- should only be able to move left up to the edge of orig_col
- should only be able to move right up to the existing length of input LEN(s$)
- where can move left or right can also use CTRL-LEFT or CTRL-RIGHT to go to prev/next word

op (op_pos) = orig_col - cx = how many positions from the left

op possibilities:
o1 = backspace      o3 = move caret left
o2 = delete         o4 = move caret right

(. = space allowed up to max)

conditions for checks              op      o1      o2      o3      o4
A      behind   : aaa|......       3       Y       N       Y       N
B      in front : |aaa......       0       N       Y       N       Y
C      between  : a|aa......       1       Y       Y       Y       Y
  
Ao2 No cannot delete because there is nothing to the right of the cursor
Ao4 No cannot move right because already at end of input and nothing to move to
Bo1 No because cursor is already at the beginning of the input field (orig_col)
Bo3 No because cursor is already at the beginning of the input field (orig_col)

Aop s$ = s$ + k$
Bop s$ = k$ + s$
Cop s$ = MID$(s$, 0, cx%) a
       + k$
       + MID$(s$, cx%) aa


o3 = if can move left, LOCATE cur_row%, cur_col%-1
o4 = if can move right, LOCATE cur_row%, cur_col%+1

in loop:
    when key pressed get key pressed
        control keys: INS, ESC, ENTER
        cusor keys are: LEFT, RIGHT, HOME, END
        modifier keys are: BACKSPACE, DEL
        character keys are: typed character not in above

        get cursor position

        pressing INSERT toggles cursor mode, loop
        pressing ENTER accepts input if >= min AND <= max
        pressing ESC aborts
        pressing CTRL-K|X|Y 
            clear line
            move cursor to first position
            loop

        if key pressed is a character:
            ignore rest of loop if input +1 would be > max length 

        when at last position 
            pressing RIGHT does nothing
            pressing END does nothing
            pressing DELETE does nothing
            pressing LEFT moves the cursor -1 position to the left
            pressing BACKSPACE
                removes char at end of input
                moves cursor -1 position to the left
            typing a character
                append a character to the last position
                position cursor to the right of typed position

        when at first position
            pressing LEFT does nothing
            pressing BACKSPACE does nothing
            pressing HOME does nothing
            pressing RIGHT moves cursor +1 position to the right
            pressing END moves cursor to last position
            pressing DELETE
                removes char right of cursor
                move all following chars left by -1
                keep current cursor position
            typing a character
                insert character at first position
                if insert mode
                    move all characters in front of cursor to the right by +1
                locate cursor +1 right of typed char position

        when not at first or last positions
            pressing RIGHT moves cursor +1 position to the right
            pressing LEFT moves cursor -1 position to the left
            pressing HOME moves cursor to first position
            pressing END moves cursor to last position
            pressing DELETE
                removes char right of cursor
                move all following chars left by -1
                keep current cursor position
            pressing BACKSPACE
                remove char left of cursor
                if insert mode
                    moves all following chars left by -1
                moves cursor -1 position to the left
            when insert mode is on
                typing a character
                    inserts character behind cursor
                    moves all characters in front of cursor to the right by +1
                    locates the cursor +1 right of typed char position
            when overwrite mode is on
                typing a character
                    overwrites character cursor is on
                    locates the cursor +1 right of typed char position
