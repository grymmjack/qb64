| = cursor

cursor rules:
- should only be able to move left up to the edge of orig_col
- should only be able to move right up to the existing length of input LEN(s$)
- where can move left or right can also use CTRL-LEFT or CTRL-RIGHT to go to prev/next word

op (op_pos) = orig_col - cx = how many positions from the left

op possibilities:
o1 = backspace      o3 = move caret left
o2 = delete         o4 = move caret right

(. = space allowed up to max)

conditions for checks              op      o1      o2      o3      o4
A      behind   : aaa|......       3       Y       N       Y       N
B      in front : |aaa......       0       N       Y       N       Y
C      between  : a|aa......       1       Y       Y       Y       Y
  
Ao2 No cannot delete because there is nothing to the right of the cursor
Ao4 No cannot move right because already at end of input and nothing to move to
Bo1 No because cursor is already at the beginning of the input field (orig_col)
Bo3 No because cursor is already at the beginning of the input field (orig_col)

Aop s$ = s$ + k$
Bop s$ = k$ + s$
Cop s$ = MID$(s$, 0, cx%) a
       + k$
       + MID$(s$, cx%) aa


o3 = if can move left, LOCATE cur_row%, cur_col%-1
o4 = if can move right, LOCATE cur_row%, cur_col%+1
