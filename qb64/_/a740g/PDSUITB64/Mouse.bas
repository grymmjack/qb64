' NOTE:     This sample source code toolbox is intended to demonstrate some
'           of the extended capabilities of Microsoft BASIC 7.1 Professional
'           Development system that can help to leverage the professional
'           developer's time more effectively.  While you are free to use,
'           modify, or distribute the routines in this module in any way you
'           find useful, it should be noted that these are examples only and
'           should not be relied upon as a fully-tested "add-on" library.
'
'  PURPOSE: These routines are required for mouse support in the user
'           interface toolbox, but they may be used independently as well.
'
'  For information on creating a library and QuickLib from the routines
'  contained in this file, read the comment header of GENERAL.BAS.
