# WINMIDI PLAYER 64

This is a [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe) compatible MIDI player library that uses [Win32 WinMM MIDI streaming APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/).

## FEATURES

- Easy plug-&-play API optimized for demos & games
- Works with both 64-bit and 32-bit QB64-PE complier
- Everything is statically linked (no DLL dependency; unlike [this](https://qb64phoenix.com/qb64wiki/index.php/DLL_Libraries))
- Demo player that shows how to use the library
- Contains a simple asyncronous .WAV (ACM compressed) player too that supports looping. Great for background .WAV music

## USAGE

- Clone the repository to a directory of your choice
- Open Terminal and change to the directory using an appropriate OS command
- Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize, fetch and checkout git submodules
- Open *WinMIDIPlayer64.bas* in the QB64-PE IDE and press `F5` to compile and run
- To use the library in your project add the [Toolbox64](https://github.com/a740g/Toolbox64) repositiory as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

## NOTES

- This requires the latest version of [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe/releases)
- This works on Windows only because it makes use of the Windows API
- To use something more cross-platform see [MIDI Player 64](https://github.com/a740g/MIDI-Player-64) or QB64-PE's [$MIDISOUNDFONT](https://qb64phoenix.com/qb64wiki/index.php/$MIDISOUNDFONT)
- When you clone a repository that contains submodules, the submodules are not automatically cloned by default
- You will need to use the `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize, fetch and checkout git submodules
- MIDI support is built into [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe/releases) using [TinySoundFont](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont) and [TinyMidiLoader](https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont)
- This can be used when you want to eliminate the extra storage used by soundfonts on Windows
