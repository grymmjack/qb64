              ==========================================
                      Dav's IDE v1.29 - (c) 2013
                   A simple IDE for the QB64 Compiler
              ===========================================


                    * * * * CHANGE LOG * * * *
                            

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 v1.29
 -----

 * Added: 'Insert Custom Comments' to edit menu.  User can set custom comments
          to quickly insert into programs.  Comments saved in the .INI file.  
          Set this in the 'IDE Settings/More IDE Settings/Set Custom Comments'.

 * Added: Option to only compile files with a .BAS extension (off by default).
          You may toggle this ON/OFF in the 'Compiler Options' menu.

 * Added: Optional Precompiler action to run before compiling. Can turn ON/OFF 
         (default OFF). Set the Precompiler in the 'Compiler Options' menu.

 * Added; 'Insert _RGB() color' to edit menu. Select a Color and the proper
          _RGB code for it will be added in your code, like: _RGB(123, 33, 88) 

 * Added: Added 'Clear Recent Files List' option in 'More IDE Settings' menu.

 * Fixed: FINALLY fixed the 'Recent Files' sorting bug. Duplicates removed and 
          are listed in order used. Last file opened shown first, etc. 
          (This was surprisingly tough to work out!).


 v1.28
 -----

 * Added: Pressing ENTER while in the "Find Text" dialog box can start a search
          and can also continue searching (find next). 

 * Added: 'Find/Replace' now opens with any text user may have highlighted first.
          You dont have to type it in the box, just highlight the text beforehand.
          (note: currently restriced to data on a single line)

 * Added: Courtesy notice given when selecting 'Open file in QB64' that this action 
          will save the file first and any current changes.  User has the option to
          proceed or not (If not then the file changes won't be saved). 

 * Fixed: Bug where saving after compiling then pressing F5 executed compiler again 
          instead of running the last compiled program. 


 v1.27
 -------------

 * Added: Can now specify the QB64 compiler switch to use when compiling.
          Defaults to -c, but you can change it to another one (like -x)
          Look in the 'Compiler options...' menu for the change.
          The current switch is now shown in the 'COMPILER=' info line.

 * Fixed: Changed name of TEMP file used in compiling to a name compatable
          with older QB64 compiler versions, (Now: _$DavsIDE-TEMPFILE.BAS)

 * Changed: 'Modify COMMAND$...' replaces 'Optional Parameters to pass to
             your EXE..." in the 'Compile' menu. (works like in QB45 IDE)

 * Fixed: Corrected possible .INI saving/loading issue on certain systems.



 v1.26
 -------------

 * Added: Command-line parameters can now be passed along to your compiled 
          program when the IDE Runs it (Like QB does it).  Look for it under
          the menu: 'Compile / Optional parameters to pass to EXE...'.

 * Fixed: Fixed bug where compiler couldn't find supporting BI/.BM files when 
          BAS was located in a directory other than the compiler.

 * Fixed: Saving BAS changes made compiler think the code was unmodified and
          would just run the last compiled EXE instead of compiling it.

 * Fixed: (fingers crossed) fixed bug where after compiling a modified BAS
          the IDE failed to ask user to save it first before closing it.


 v1.25
 -------------

 * Added: TEMP file compiling. Compiling BAS no longer auto-saves the BAS first,
          so you can edit + compile without making the BAS change permanant until
          you save the edited BAS file yourself.  You can also compile & run
          untitled programs (without saving it as a BAS first).

 * Fixed: Saving/Compiling a file now does NOT empty the undo/redo buffer.
          (So after a test compile, you can undo what you did before compiling)

 * Fixed: Pressing F5 now re-compiles ONLY if BAS has been modified again.
          If it hasn't been modified, the IDE runs the last compiled EXE.
          Changed compile menu item to "Run/Compile" to reflect this.

 * Added: Save/Load/Select all of the Notebox data (right click in Notebook).
          (Tweaked notebook color - will add user selected colors next release)

 * Fixed: File open dialog now defaults to list all QB64 files (BAS/BI/BM)
          You Can still filter them separately. (Also Added .BM files to list)

 * Added: Added a Toggle for displaying full path or just the filename in title bar.
          (Turned on by default - Look in the 'MORE IDE SETTINGS' menu for it)

 * Added: Gave a Shortcut to the 'Go to Line' number: (Ctrl+G) 

 * Added: ESC key can now close all HELP windows and ASCII Chart.

 * Added: Added the following new GL keywords to the IDE (Edit/Help/Status bar syntax):
          _MEMEXISTS,$RESIZE,_RESIZE,_RESIZEHEIGHT,_RESIZEWIDTH,_SNDRAWDONE,_SNDRAWOPEN

 * Fixed: Various typos in the HELP stuff.


 v1.24
 -------------

 * Changed SUB/FUNCTION selection box.  Made it larger and gave it the 
   QB-like font to match the rest of IDE style.  It's easier to use now.

 * Fixed IDE from moving cursor position when the user canceled selecting
   a SUB/FUNCTION from the SUB/FUNCTION selection box.

 * Added "Please wait" message while SUB/FUNCTIONs list loads. On large 
   sources containing hundreds of SUBs it may take a second or two.

 * Fixed TAB (CHR$(9))from triggering a low ASCII warning when loading a
   file.  (TABs are displayed & handled correctly in the IDE anyway)

 * Added pressing ESC to also close some IDE windows, like the Note Box.


 v1.23
 -------------

 * Fixed the Advanced Right Click Menu bug (appeared in v1.18) where the
   recent file List was mysteriously added to the bottom of the pop menu
   when a main menu selection occurred - resulting in a very long popup
   menu display. This may be a Purebasic/SDL bug, which I only fixed by 
   destroying & recreating the popup menu after every menu selection.

 * Fixed a Title bar bug where the filename in the title bar was being 
   changed even when the user canceled saving/loading a file.


 v1.22
 -------------

 * Added "Go to SUB" and "Go to FUNCTION" in the new "Go to" menu.
   A list of all SUB/FUNCTION currently contained in the code is 
   displayed and the user can jump to them by double-clicking on
   the name. This will exentually be changed to "View.." and they 
   will be shown & edited separately from the main code (WIP).

 * Moved "Go to Line number..." from Edit menu to the Go to menu. 

 * Added current line number display at bottom right so you can
   still know the current line when line-display is turned off.


 v1.21
 -------------

 * Added choice of 3 Font sizes to the IDE editing window:
   12pt (9x16), 14pt (10x19) and 16pt (11x22).  Font size defaults
   to 12pt when first run, but you can set a new size from the
   "IDE Settings" menu.  The size will be remembered next time.
   The Font type is "Codepage 437" and cannot be changed.


 v1.20
 -------------

 * Added Realtime keyword Syntax usage displayed in StatusBar.
   Typing keywords in IDE updates StatusBar with correct usage.
   Navigating the cursor on a keyword (by arrows or mouse) will 
   update statusbar with that keyword syntax and help info.
 * Fixed a memory releasing issue when exiting IDE.
   

 v1.19
 -------------

 * Added a Toolbar of standard file editing actions.  Toolbar view
   can be toggled ON/OFF in IDE SETTINGS Menu (It's ON by default).
 * Added a "More IDE Settings..." Sub-Menu, to hold More of course.
   Put some older items in there to prevent an ever growing menu.
 * Fixed Undo/Redo buffer. Now correctly resets Scintilla Undo/Redo 
   buffer when doing any File New/Loading/Saving.
 * Added option to reset all colors in custom scheme to default.
   (just in case you want to start it all over from scratch)
 * Added a set Bookmark color option to the custom color scheme.


 v1.18
 -------------

 * Added Optional Autoloading of last opened file on IDE startup.
   The Autoload option is turned OFF by default (in IDE SETTINGS).
   After autoloading, the last editing line is remembered and set.
   Opening files from the commandline overides Autoloading, so you
   can associate BAS files with the IDE and open them as usual.
 * Increased number of recent files to 8, gave them numbers menu.
 * Fixed IDE from saying you have the latest version if it failed 
   to connect to the website when checking for a new version. 
   

 v1.17
 -------------

 * Added "Check for new version online" in Help menu.
   If new version found, gives option of opening link.
 * Added Option to check for new version on startup (IDE Settings).
   The automaic check on startup is turned OFF by default.
   (DavsIDE won't go online unless YOU say so...)
 * Changed HELP shortcut to F1 from Ctrl+L (that was reassigned).
   F1 is the standard shortcut in windows programs.
 * Added Ctrl+Q Shortcut to "Open File in QB64".
 * Added Ctrl+L Shortcut to "Run Last Compiled EXE"
 * Added List of IDE Shortcuts in Help menu


 v1.16
 -------------

 * Added Bookmarks - Mark/Unmark line, jump to mark, clear all.
   Bookmarks not yet saved with files and lost when file reloaded.
 * Added a user Note Box (in Help menu) to save users notes, etc.
   The Data is saved in DavsIDE.ini and will be remembered.
 * Added * in title bar to denote file is modified and not saved.
   Only shows on real, previously saved files (not untitled.bas)
 * Fixed several internal things not worth explaining.  


 v1.15
 -------------

 * Added "Compiler Options" letting you set compiler location,
   and option of making EXE in the same location as BAS source.
   The current set compiler location is shown in the menu.
 * Added "Run Last Compiled EXE" option to the compile menu.
 * Added "Recent Files" list to the File menu for easy access.
 * Added 26 new QB64 keywords/syntax to the IDE (QB64 v0.954).
 * Added PRINT Shortcut (?) to the Syntax highlighted keywords.
 * Fixed bug that caused IDE to constantly ask to save file.
   (only happened when the BAS file was named UNTITLED.BAS)
 * Fixed bug that cause stray DavsIDE.ini files to be created
   if the IDE wasn't run from within the QB64 folder.
    

 v1.14
 -------------

 * Added built-in HELP for all QB64 Keywords.
   Read the HELP help page for more information. 
   (in the HELP box type: HELP)

 -------------

 * Added ability to fully customize IDE colors.
   Now you can create your own IDE color scheme.
 * Changed Default IDE color scheme to a new one.
   Old default scheme still available as 'Xebron'.
   (that makes 11 built-in schemes + 1 user defined)
 * Added a QB64 keyword to the syntax highlighting.

 * (DavsIDE.ini settings file created in program  directory)


 v1.11
 -------------

 * Added Toggle Autocase Keywords On/Off.
 * Added Toggle syntax Highlight On/Off.
   ( The above two changes were added to allow non-QB64 )
   ( text files, like C/PHP/HTML, to be edited better.  )
 * Consolidated all IDE Settings to the IDE Settings menu.
