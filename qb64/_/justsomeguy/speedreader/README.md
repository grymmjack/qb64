# Speed Reader
This is a program to view text files using one word at a time in rapid succession. Instead of the traditional way of reading, this displays one word at a time in rapid succession. 
The speed is adjustable and is adaptive to the length of the word.  Your place is automatically saved when you exit the application or even when you switch text files. You can change the font, the font size, and font color from the pause menu.
