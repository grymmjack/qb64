This program is FREEWARE! Share it with your friends! :D

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was made in a little over 3 hours across a single livestream
hosted on Twitch for the purpose of creating a custom font for a much larger
coding project to follow. It is not well tested so if you're going to use it
for any serious work I highly recommend saving often and mounting it inside
a solo DOSBox folder so as not to expose any other mounted files to potential
crashes!

Use the arrow keys to move the edit cursor and spacebar to plot/unplot the
bits in a glyph. Use the numreic keypad (with NumLock on, may need to flip
it off and on a couple times with DOSBox) to change the active glyph being
edited. Note that because you're changing the text mode glyphs the changes
will affects the editor's contents in real time.

If you screw up royally and lose sight of everything you can press ESC or F2
followed by Y to either exit out of the program or reset to the default font.
