<>>> About Sprite
-----------------
     Sprite is a graphics editor designed with game programmers in
     mind. It allows the creation of any size sprite from 3x3 to
     64x64. Although the mouse is reguired for SPRITE to run all editing 
     can be done with the keyboard (except for selecting palette colors).

     Using Sprite is pretty strait forward, Left click on a frame to
     edit and a menu will appear or use the arrow keys to select a
     frame and press enter. Select the desired operation from the menu.

     Right click on the mouse to pull down the Main Menu. Or use the
     Esc key. The Esc key will also back you out of menus with no
     action.


<>>> Modifying the QBINVADE.SPR file:
-----------------------------------
     Load in the QBINVADE.SPR file. Modify it or make an entirely new set.
     Just keep the images in the same order as the original and leave
     blank frames blank.

     Also  don't "save" past the last frame in the third row. Saving
     past this frame will make the sprite file to large for the
     QB Invaders game to use and may cause your computer to lock up
     when running it.

     Save the file with an original name. Then at the DOS prompt type :

                  copy yourfile.spr yourfile.img

     and press enter. When you start QB Invaders your image set will be
     on the file menu !
