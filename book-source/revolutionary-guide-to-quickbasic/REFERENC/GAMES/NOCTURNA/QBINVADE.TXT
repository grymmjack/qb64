<>> About
----------------
 QB Invaders is donationware. If you enjoy it consider sending a
 dollar or so. In return for your good deed I'll send back nastier
 aliens , more levels, and the QuickBasic source code.

<>> Requirements
----------------
 QB Invaders requires a VGA monitor.

  
<>> Playing
----------------
 The game premise is identicle to Space Invaders. Shoot all the aliens
 using your mobile ground based missle launcher before they land on earth.

 The left Alt key moves your launcher left and the left Ctrl key moves
 your launcher to the right. Once you have an alien lined up in your
 sights hit the Space bar to fire a missle.

 Once in a while the command ship will come around to check on the alien
 troops. Shoot him for bonus points. Wait for the right moment and you get
 a free life.

 Clear all the aliens in a wave and you'll move onto battle quicker
 and nastier aliens. Good Luck !
